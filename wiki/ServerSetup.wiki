#summary Using external configuration files to modify parameters after the source has been compiled

=Running DKPro-TC experiments on a server=

All DKPro-TC projects are Maven projects, which makes it easy to deploy them to a server, e.g. via the maven-deploy-plugin. This might be necessary for long running experiments or large data sets which require lots of memory during processing. To avoid having to recompile the source every time you want to change a some configuration parameter, we have added a demo project which showcases how to call an external groovy script from within a Java wrapper using the GroovyClassLoader to run the groovy setup script: the _sentimentpolarity_ demo.

The external groovy script (located in src/main/resources/scripts) looks very similar to the compiled Groovy scripts which we are using to start the _twentynewsgroups_, _reuters_ and _regression_ demo projects. To run your own experiments using external scripts, you only need to have a small Java wrapper similar to the `SentimentPolarityExperimentStarter`, which extends `ExperimentStarter` and specifies where to find the external Groovy script. For more details, have a look at the _sentimentpolarity_ demo.
