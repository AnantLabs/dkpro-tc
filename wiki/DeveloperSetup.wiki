=Basic Setup (of Eclipse and Maven) =
  * If you have a current eclipse version, it should already come with m2e (Maven integration) built-in. If not, follow [https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/UserSetup these instructions] and restart eclipse
  * If you do not have a settings.xml file in your .m2 directory, use the one provided [https://dkpro-tc.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/misc/settings.xml here]. Otherwise, add the repositories from this settings.xml to your existing configuration.

= Checking out a snapshot=
  * Open the SVN Repositories perspective in Eclipse (Menu -> Window ->   Show View -> Other... -> SVN -> SVN Repositories)
  * Add a SVN repository with the URL http://dkpro-tc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  * Expand the new repository node in the SVN Repositories view
  * Right-click on trunk and select Check out as Maven project
    * Note: if you do not see this menu item, make sure you have installed the Maven SCM handler for Subclipse.
  * (optional) Eclipse will create some projects now. We recommend to group these projects into a working set:
    * Select Next
    * Check Add project(s) to working set
    * Click More...
    * Click New...
    * Double-click Java
    * Enter the working set name DKPRO-TC
    * Click Finish
    * Click OK
    * Select the working set DKPRO-TC from the working set drop-down box
      * Note: when you are completely through with these and the following steps, remember to go to the Package Explorer view. There is a small triangular icon in its top right corner. Click on that and select Top   Level Elements -> Working Sets.
  * Click Finish.
