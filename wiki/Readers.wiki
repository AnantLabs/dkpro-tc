#summary How to set up a DKPro-TC reader

=Creating a reader for your data=

For reference, you should have a look at the readers of the `io` package in the `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.tc.examples-gpl` module.

==Minimal requirements==

All DKPro-TC readers should implement either `TCReaderSingleLabel` (single-label classification and regression experiments) or `TCReaderMultiLabel` (multi-label classification experiments).

A reader in DKPro-TC needs to define at least:
  * the structure of the UIMA CAS (i.e. the document text)
  * the classification outcome (i.e. the class labels of the document)

You can re-use most readers from the `io` modules of [http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl DKPro Core], which contain readers for different simple data formats such as TXT or HTML, but also readers for popular data collections, e.g. the BNC.
If your DKPro-TC reader inherits from a DKPro Core reader, you don't have to care about the structure of the CAS, but only need to additionally specify the `getTextClassificationOutcome()`. The latter sets the document labels.
