= Introduction =
Models trained with DKPro TC are not usable as independent components in pipelines, yet.
We thus can't take advantage of once created models.
In order to make trained TC models reusable, the necessary TC related components have to be deployed together with the model wrapped into a prediction-mode component.

I see essentially 3 stages of TC model reusability

= Stage 1 (TC reusable) =
Trained models can be used within a TC pipeline in a developing environment.
This is largely achieved.
Open points are:
  * User defined features have to be provided (loop-hole here: copy user-defined features into TC project that loads model - ugly code redundants, but works)
  * Implicit requirement that features that are part of the TC feature package are present in the classpath somewhere
  * No version awareness if feature XY is needed and it is found in the classpath/workspace it is taken (feature might have changed between TC versions ...,0.6, 0.7) this might lead to unintended side-effects / different results which are extremely hard to track from the user perspective

= Stage 2 (DKProCore / UIMA reusable) = 

= Stage 3 (standalone application ) =
