#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= Initial setup =

*When I check out the TC project, I see maven compiler version errors in many folders such as demos.*
  * Even when you don't want to use Groovy in your experiment but the pure java setup, you need to have Groovy plug-in installed in order to initially compile the demos. Alternatively you need to modify maven dependencies in the poms.

*What is DKPRO_HOME used for?*
  * It can be any writable folder anywhere in your system (if it does not exist, it gets created as soon as you run the experiment), where TC stores outputs of the individual tasks (i.e. pre-processed data, extracted features...) and various task reports, but also the final output (i.e. classification result). Hence you will probably want to look into this folder whenever your experiment is finished.
